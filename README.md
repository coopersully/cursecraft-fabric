Cursecraft is an all-in-one fabric mod for Minecraft: Java Edition that aims to do one thing: expand the survival experience; it implements new items, blocks, dimensions, game mechanics, and more, all tied together with a connected storyline. Unlike our previous datapacks such as [Vanilla Expansion](https://github.com/coopersully/vanilla-expansion), the goal of this datapack is to completely overhaul the survival experience. Cursecraft adds brand new questlines, items, blocks, mobs, game mechanics, dimensions, potions, enchantments, and so much more.
